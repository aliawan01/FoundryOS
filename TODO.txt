TODO:

    - [ ] Setup IDT
    - [ ] Setup .gdbinit so that we don't have to manually do 
            load build/foundryos
            target remote localhost:1234
        every time we want to debug
    - [ ] Add a flag which will automatically add `-s -S` to qemu
          in run.sh when we want to debug stuff.
    - [ ] Figure out how the framebuffer works on draw a rectangle.
